# Creating a case study : Roadmap

### The six phases of data analysis:

In the ask phase, you’ll work to understand the challenge to be solved or the question to be  answered. It will likely be assigned to you by stakeholders. As this is the ask phase, you’ll ask many questions to help you along the way. 

Next, in the prepare phase, you’ll find and collect the data you'll need to answer your questions. You’ll identify data sources, gather data, and verify that it is accurate and useful for answering your questions. 

The process phase is when you will clean and organize your data. Tasks you perform here include removing any inconsistencies; filling in missing values; and, in many cases, changing the data to a format that's easier to work with. Essentially, you’re ensuring the data is ready before you begin analysis.

The analyze phase is when you do the necessary data analysis to uncover answers and solutions. Depending on the situation and the data, this could involve tasks such as calculating averages or counting items in categories so you can examine trends and patterns.

Next comes the share phase, when you present your findings to decision-makers through a report, presentation, or data visualizations. As part of the share phase, you decide which medium you want to use to share your findings and select the data to include. Tools for presenting data visually include charts made in Google Sheets, Tableau, and R. 

Last is the act phase, in which you and others in the company put the data insights into action. This could mean implementing a new business strategy, making changes to a website, or any other action that solves the initial problem.

4. What trends or relationships have you found in the data?
5. How do these insights answer your question or solve the problem?

## Key tasks
Now you’ll really put your data to work to uncover new insights and discover potential solutions to your problem!
1. Aggregate your data so it’s useful and accessible
2. Organize and format your data
3. Perform calculations
4. Identify trends and relationships


# Step 5: SHARE

## Guiding questions
1. What story does your data tell?
2. How do your findings relate to your original question?
3. Who is your audience? What is the best way to communicate with them?
4. Can data visualization help you share your findings?
5. Is your presentation accessible to your audience?

## Key tasks
During the share phase, you’ll tell a story using data and communicate your findings.
1. Determine the best way to share your findings
2. Create effective data visualizations
3. Present your findings
4. Ensure your work is accessible to your audience


# Step 6: ACT

## Guiding questions
1. What is your final conclusion based on your analysis?
2. How can you apply your insights?
